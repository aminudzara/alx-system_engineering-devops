# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

In this project, I learned how to do arithmetic in Shell. Also, I learned about Shell initalization files such as /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bash_profile,   
~/.bash_login, ~/.bash_logout, ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc. Finally, I learned about variables, the 'alias' command, and technical writing.
